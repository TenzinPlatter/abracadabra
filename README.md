# TODO:
- [X] get mic input into byte array
- [ ] fast fourier transform data
- [ ] split data into small sections
  * maybe 100ms?? can't be too small
  * might have to use 'hamming window function' to avoid 'spectral leakage'
- [ ] create spectrogram (maybe make a quick visualizer for this?)
- [ ] fingerprint data (decide on algorithm)
- [ ] get mp3 files into byte array
- [ ] store mp3 data (for searchable songs)
- [ ] hash lookup for song matches
- [ ] decide which song match is the best match (probably smthing like most clustered matches)
- [ ] make frontend
